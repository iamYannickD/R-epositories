# HDBSCAN Clustering Project

Advanced density-based clustering analysis using HDBSCAN algorithm.

## Project Timeline
- Started: September 06, 2024
- Completed: February 28, 2025
- Intensive development period: November 2024

## Key Features
- Progressive parameter optimization
- Cluster validation metrics
- Advanced visualization
- Noise handling
- Performance optimizations

## Files
- `hdbscan_analysis.R`: Main analysis script (evolved through versions)
- `cluster_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset (with progressive complexity)
- `cluster_results.csv`: Output with cluster assignments

## Usage
Run the analysis script to perform HDBSCAN clustering on the provided data.

```
source('hdbscan_analysis.R')
```
